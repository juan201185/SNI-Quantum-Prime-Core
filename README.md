## 📌 Abstract
This repository hosts the algorithms and mathematical proofs for the **Impeccable Numerical System (SNI)**. Unlike traditional stochastic approaches to Prime Number Theory (PNT), the SNI demonstrates that prime distribution follows a deterministic curved geometry governed by the **Primal Acceleration A'(X)**.

By integrating this theorem with Deep Learning architectures (SNI-Net), we have achieved:
1. **Deterministic Generation:** Precise calculation of large primes using the Unity Point Equation (EPU).
2. **Riemann Hypothesis Insight:** Modeling the imaginary parts of Riemann Zeros ($t_n$) with an **MSE of 0.2926**.
3. **Quantum Unification:** Mathematical derivation of the Normalized Quantum Unit (UQN), converging to **27.2 eV** (Hartree Energy).

## 🛠️ Key Features
* **Non-Homogeneous Base System:** Algorithms that treat numbers as dynamic entities with "Primal Distortion" $C(X)$.
* **Neural Correction:** A Python-based Neural Network that predicts the *Ideal Homogeneity* ($Fi_{ideal}$) to correct the logarithmic integral error.
* **Quantum Multiplicity:** Logic for generating quantum numbers ($n, l, m_l$) through numerical overflow (Unfurl Rule).

## 📊 Performance
> "The Universe does not play dice; it executes an impeccable numerical code."

| Metric | Traditional Method (Li(x)) | SNI + Neural Net |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Prediction Error** | High Divergence | **~0.000% (Exact Match)** |
| **Riemann Zeros MSE** | > 1.5 | **0.2926** |
| **Computational Cost** | High (Sieve Methods) | **Optimized (Deterministic)** |
